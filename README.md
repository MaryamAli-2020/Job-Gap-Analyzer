## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a local copy of the project up and running.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v20 or later recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
- A Google AI API Key. You can get one from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/career-compass.git
    cd career-compass
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a file named `.env` in the root of your project and add your Google AI API key:
    ```env
    GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key_here
    ```

4.  **Run the development server:**
    The application consists of the Next.js frontend and the Genkit backend. Run them concurrently in separate terminals.

    *   **Terminal 1: Start the Next.js app:**
        ```bash
        npm run dev
        ```
        Your application should now be running at [http://localhost:9002](http://localhost:9002).

    *   **Terminal 2: Start the Genkit development server:**
        ```bash
        npm run genkit:dev
        ```
        This starts the Genkit flows and makes them available for your Next.js application to call.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

The application's logic is orchestrated through a series of AI flows defined with Genkit:

1.  **Resume Upload (`/components/app/resume-upload.tsx`):** The user uploads their resume file. The file is converted to a Base64 data URI.
2.  **Resume Parsing (`/ai/flows/resume-parser.ts`):** The data URI is sent to the `parseResume` flow. Gemini's multimodal capabilities are used to read the document and extract structured JSON data (name, skills, experience, etc.).
3.  **Job Matching (`/ai/flows/job-matcher.ts`):** The extracted resume data is passed to the `jobMatcher` flow. This flow uses an AI-powered `searchJobsTool` (`/ai/tools/job-search.ts`) to formulate a search query based on the user's profile and find relevant job listings.
4.  **Skill Gap Analysis (`/ai/flows/skill-gap-analyzer.ts`):** When the user clicks "Analyze Skill Gap" for a specific job, the `analyzeSkillGaps` flow is invoked. It compares the text from the resume against the job description to identify matches, gaps, and suggestions.
5.  **Resource Recommendation (`/ai/flows/resource-recommender.ts`):** The summary from the skill gap analysis is then passed to the `recommendResources` flow, which suggests targeted learning materials to help the user become a stronger candidate.
